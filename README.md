Hi, I'm a Tasmanian amateur/learning programmer, newbie author, and aerospace enthusiast. 
I live in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, which is a really nice place, right on a river.

I just finished and published a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMYP6QW6?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_R95FS9BT4WSDCXEE34TD) on kindle on the future of space exploration, which was really fun to write - now that I have that weight off my back, I hope to get better at programming and computer science. Right now I'm not really that good at coding, so I want to hone my skills and make some stuff. Lately I've been playing around with node.js
