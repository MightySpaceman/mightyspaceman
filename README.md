#### It's me!

Hi, I'm a Tasmanian programmer, author and youtuber.
I live in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, which is a really nice place, right on a river.

I'm currently writing a book about the future of space exploration, which will probably release somewhere in the next month or so. No guarantees though.
I'm also dedicating myself to learn networking and hacking techniques (for the better of course, #ethicalhacking), which has been pretty fun so far...I still have a way to go on the networking side, but I've been making lots of software involving social engineering and a sprinkle of trolling, which you can take a look on my [repositories page](https://github.com/MightySpaceman?tab=repositories). I'm especially proud of my [UltimateGrabber](https://github.com/MightySpaceman/UltimateGrabber/) script.
