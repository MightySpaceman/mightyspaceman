#### It's me!

Hi, I'm a Tasmanian amateur/learning programmer, newbie author, and aerospace enthusiast. 
I live in Hobart, the capital of Tasmania, which is a really nice place, right on a river.

I just finished and published a [book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BMYP6QW6?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ud_dp_R95FS9BT4WSDCXEE34TD) on kindle on the future of space exploration, which was really fun to write - now that I have that weight off my back, I hope to get better at programming and computer science. Right now I'm not really that good at coding, so I want to hone my skills and make some stuff.

I'm still figuring out what the best thing to dedicate myself to learning will be; So far, I've mostly done python and a bit of C. I'll probably end up doing either javascript or C++. Javascript is really versatile, which would be a benefit - but for some reason C++ has something that keeps drawing me towards it.
